# How to subset dataframes in Python

## Focusing only on [], .loc, and .iloc

df[ ] <br />
df.loc[ ] <br />
df.iloc[ ] <br />

Select a single column as a Series by passing the column name directly to it:  <br /> df['col_name']

Select multiple columns as a DataFrame by passing a list to it:  <br />  df[['col_name1', 'col_name2']]
